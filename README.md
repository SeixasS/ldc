This is a Computational Design Laboratory project named The “Ctrl+Alt+5” project. 
It is a reflection about being human on the Anthropocene, how is our relationship
with what surround us:the environment, the animals, and non-humans.
An digital artefact is presented as a medium of it is a unique way to give 
to the viewer the possibility to be emerged in an environment that overlaps
real space and data space. 
The aim is to explore creatively not only in the pursuit of
new aesthetics but new ways of thinking new solutions for humanity.
As a guide for the conceptual network involved in this project , it
has been analysed the nature of the overlaps between human, animal
and non-human (mechanical/machine) and different Nietzsche´s conception
“overman” (der Ubermensch ¨ ). In the state of art we analyse the
project portraits the “embodiment” of the interaction between humans,
machines, and animals . with this artefact it is aimed to incite discussion 
and consciousness about the elusive boundaries between the three
of them As a result of the public interaction with the artefact, it will be
created several individual images of “a fourth entity” - a mix between
human, non-human(machine)and animals- that will compose a larger image of a 
“fifth entity”- “Ctrl+Alt+5” using technology which enables the
caption of the human body image and the real time single /multi-person
2D pose estimation.
